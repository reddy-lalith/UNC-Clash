## üöÄ About UNC-Clash

UNC-Clash is a web application that gamifies comparing anonymous LinkedIn profiles from UNC students. Users can vote on which profile they find more impressive, with an Elo rating system tracking profile rankings over time. The platform creates a fun, interactive way to see how different career paths, experiences, and profiles stack up against each other.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Profile Battles**: Vote on pairs of anonymized LinkedIn profiles
- **Elo Rating System**: Profiles gain or lose points based on battle outcomes
- **Leaderboard**: See the highest-rated profiles
- **Battle History**: Track recent comparison results
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Opt-In/Out**: Students can choose to remove their profile from the platform
